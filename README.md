# Installation
First, HTSlib must be installed on your system. To do that, [download](http://www.htslib.org/download/) it and follow the "Building and installing" instructions on that page.

Then, download this code, extract it, `cd` to where you extracted it, and run the following:
```sudo ldconfig # only needs to be run the first time
./compile.sh
sudo ./install.sh```
